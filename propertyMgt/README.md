# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```

// Write a property Management contract that can:
// ### Requirement

// * create a property.
// * add intuitive property details during creation.
// * remove a property.
// * get all properties.
// * properties are for sale and have their prices.
// * buy / purchase property.
// * use the openzeppellin library for payments with your own token.
// * Introduce the use of role based access with modifiers.
